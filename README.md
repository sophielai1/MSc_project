# Comparing Air Quality and Associated Effects in Chinese Rural Villages from a Coal-to-Electricity Policy Intervention

## MSc Research Project

## 1. Project Background

### 1.1 Air Pollution in China

Air pollution is fast becoming a major challenge faced by society, integrated in our daily lives, and is a considerable concern in public health and influencing government policies across the globe. A large proportion of energy consumed in China is through coal combustion, which is a large contributor to high levels of air pollution in China and is what sets it apart from other countries which combust lower levels of coal and also use a lot of it to generate electricity.

### 1.2 PM<sub>2.5</sub>

The air pollutant investigated in this study is PM<sub>2.5</sub>, defined as fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5μm. It has been classified as carcinogenic and increased levels have been associated with decreased life expectancy. Additionally, it has been shown to be a risk factor for stroke, which is the leading cause of death in China.

The 24 hour average limits for PM<sub>2.5</sub> are as follows:  
World Health Organisation: 15μg/m<sup>3</sup>  
Chinese government: 75μg/m<sup>3</sup>
